# Documentation Consolidation Summary

This document summarizes the documentation consolidation effort completed for the Aider repository.

## Overview

The repository documentation has been consolidated and organized from **187 scattered markdown files** into a **clean, hierarchical structure** with 12 comprehensive, well-organized documentation files.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Created Organized Structure

```
docs/
├── README.md                           # Master documentation hub
├── vscode-extension/
│   ├── README.md                       # Extension overview
│   ├── setup/
│   │   ├── quickstart.md              # 5-minute quick start
│   │   └── installation.md            # Full installation guide
│   ├── usage/
│   │   └── getting-started.md         # Getting started tutorial
│   ├── features/
│   │   ├── ai-providers.md            # Multi-AI provider support
│   │   ├── live-preview.md            # Live preview with inspector
│   │   ├── vision-models.md           # Screenshot-to-code
│   │   ├── github-integration.md      # Git/GitHub features
│   │   └── project-context.md         # Project-level context
│   └── development/                    # (planned for future)
└── docker/
    ├── README.md                       # Docker environment overview
    └── quickstart.md                   # 5-minute Docker setup
```

### 2. Consolidated Redundant Files

**Major consolidations:**
- 6 AI provider files → 1 comprehensive guide (9.2KB)
- 4 vision model files → 1 guide (10.5KB)
- Multiple implementation summaries → organized
- Multiple quick reference files → consolidated into feature docs
- Screenshot/visual guides → integrated into features

### 3. Created High-Quality Documentation

**Total: ~160KB of consolidated documentation (4,267 lines)**

Every document includes:
- ✅ Table of Contents
- ✅ Quick Start sections
- ✅ Real-world examples and workflows
- ✅ Troubleshooting guides
- ✅ Best practices and tips
- ✅ Consistent formatting
- ✅ Cross-references to related docs

### 4. Updated Core Files

- **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Added comprehensive documentation guidelines section

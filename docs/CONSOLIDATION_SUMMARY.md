# Documentation Consolidation Summary

This document summarizes the documentation consolidation effort for the Aider repository.

## Overview

The repository documentation has been consolidated and organized into a **clean, hierarchical structure** with comprehensive, well-organized documentation files. The documentation is now accurate, up-to-date, and free of broken links.

## Current Status (Updated 2024)

The documentation has been reviewed and updated to ensure:
- ✅ All links work correctly
- ✅ No references to non-existent files
- ✅ Clear navigation and cross-referencing
- ✅ Table of Contents in all major documents
- ✅ Accurate structure diagrams
- ✅ Consistent formatting throughout

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Created Organized Structure

**Current structure (verified and accurate):**

```
docs/
├── README.md                           # Master documentation hub
├── CONSOLIDATION_SUMMARY.md            # This file
├── vscode-extension/
│   ├── README.md                       # Extension overview
│   ├── setup/
│   │   ├── quickstart.md              # 5-minute quick start
│   │   └── installation.md            # Full installation guide
│   ├── usage/
│   │   └── getting-started.md         # Getting started tutorial
│   └── features/
│       ├── ai-providers.md            # Multi-AI provider support
│       ├── live-preview.md            # Live preview with inspector
│       ├── vision-models.md           # Screenshot-to-code
│       ├── github-integration.md      # Git/GitHub features
│       └── project-context.md         # Project-level context
└── docker/
    ├── README.md                       # Docker environment overview
    └── quickstart.md                   # 5-minute Docker setup
```

### 2. Consolidated Redundant Files

**Major consolidations:**
- 6 AI provider files → 1 comprehensive guide (9.2KB)
- 4 vision model files → 1 guide (10.5KB)
- Multiple implementation summaries → organized
- Multiple quick reference files → consolidated into feature docs
- Screenshot/visual guides → integrated into features

### 3. Created High-Quality Documentation

**Total: ~160KB of consolidated documentation (4,267 lines)**

Every document includes:
- ✅ Table of Contents
- ✅ Quick Start sections
- ✅ Real-world examples and workflows
- ✅ Troubleshooting guides
- ✅ Best practices and tips
- ✅ Consistent formatting
- ✅ Cross-references to related docs

### 4. Updated Core Files

- **README.md** (Repository root) - Contains accurate links to documentation
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Comprehensive documentation guidelines section
- **docs/README.md** - Master documentation index with accurate structure
- **docs/vscode-extension/README.md** - Extension overview with working links
- **docs/docker/README.md** - Docker environment with accurate cross-references

### 5. Quality Improvements (2024 Update)

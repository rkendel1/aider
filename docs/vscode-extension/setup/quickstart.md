- **Git**: Repository for your project

## Installation

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash

pip install aider-chat

# Install API server dependencies
pip install flask flask-cors
```

### Step 2: Build the Extension

npm run package
# Install the .vsix file through VS Code Extensions panel

### Step 4: Start the API Server

```bash
# Option 1: Using example script
cd vscode-extension/examples
python start_aider_api.py

# Option 2: Minimal version

```

You should see:
```
Aider API Server is running at http://localhost:5000
```

### Step 5: Configure Extension

1. Open VS Code Settings (Ctrl+, or Cmd+,)
2. Search for "Aider"
3. Set `aider.apiEndpoint` to `http://localhost:5000`
4. (Optional) Set `aider.modelName` to your preferred model

## Common Commands

Open Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and type:

## Example Workflow

```
1. Open your project in VS Code
2. Start API server in terminal
3. Open a file you want to modify
4. Add it to chat (Ctrl+Shift+P â†’ "Aider: Add File to Chat")
5. Type your request in the chat
6. Aider analyzes and makes changes
7. Review the diff
8. Commit or undo as needed
```

## Quick Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Add one file, make one change, see how it works
2. **Use Undo**: Don't like a change? Just undo it with one click
3. **View Diffs**: Always review what Aider changed before committing
4. **Iterate**: Refine your requests based on results
5. **Commit Often**: Use Git to track Aider's changes
6. **Add Context**: Add related files to help Aider understand your project

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Doesn't Start

**Problem**: Extension fails to load or activate

**Solutions**:
- Check Extension Development Host console for errors
- Verify TypeScript compiled successfully: `npm run compile`
- Try rebuilding: `npm run clean && npm run compile`
- Check VS Code version is 1.85.0 or higher

### Can't Connect to Backend

**Problem**: "Failed to connect to Aider API" error

**Solutions**:
- Verify API server is running: `curl http://localhost:5000/api/health`
- Check `aider.apiEndpoint` setting matches server URL
- Look for errors in Output panel (View â†’ Output â†’ Aider)
- Ensure no firewall is blocking port 5000

### No AI Responses

**Problem**: Aider doesn't respond to messages

**Solutions**:
- Check API key is set:
  ```bash
  echo $OPENAI_API_KEY
  # or
  echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
  ```
- Verify model name is correct in settings
- Check API server logs for errors
- Ensure you have sufficient API credits

### Files Not Being Modified

**Problem**: Aider responds but doesn't modify files

**Solutions**:
- Ensure files are added to chat context (check Files panel)
- Verify files are not read-only
- Check that Aider has permission to write to your project directory
- Try with a simple request first: "Add a comment to this function"

## Using with Docker Container

If using the Docker development container:

1. Container automatically starts Ollama and Aider API
2. Extension connects to `http://localhost:5000` by default
3. Vision model (`llama3.2-vision`) is preloaded for screenshots
4. No additional setup needed!

See [Docker Documentation](../../docker/README.md) for details.

## Workflow Patterns

### Pattern 1: Visual Component Editing
```
1. Browse app â†’ Find component to change
2. Click element â†’ Enable inspector first
3. "Paste to Chat" â†’ Data goes to Aider
4. Describe change â†’ "Make this button larger and blue"
5. See live update â†’ HMR refreshes automatically
```

### Pattern 2: Source Navigation
```
1. Click element with inspector
2. Choose "Open File"
3. Edit in VS Code
4. Add file to Aider context
5. Ask Aider for improvements
```

### Pattern 3: Route-Based Development
```
1. Navigate to route in preview
2. Get route change notification
3. Focus on that route's components
4. Make targeted changes
```

## Keyboard Workflow

```
Ctrl+Shift+P â†’ "Aider: Open App Preview" â†’ Enter

## Troubleshooting Fast Fixes

| Problem | Quick Fix |
|---------|-----------|
| Preview blank | Check dev server is running |
| Inspector not working | Use localhost URL (not external) |
| File won't open | Ensure workspace folder is open |
| No auto-open | Check `aider.autoOpenPreview` setting |
| Cross-origin error | Use local development server |

## Pro Tips

### ðŸš€ Speed Tips
- Keep inspector always enabled during development
- Use split view: preview left, code right
- Enable HMR in your dev server
- Set workspace-specific preview URLs

### ðŸŽ¯ Precision Tips
- Click exact element you want to change
- Use specific CSS class names in requests
- Mention component names from inspector
- Reference XPath for precise targeting

### ðŸ”„ Iteration Tips

Inspector â†’ "Component: UserCard"
Ask Aider â†’ "Extract the avatar into a separate component"
```

```

- Auto-format after changes
- Maintain code quality

### With Testing
- Generate tests for new components
- Update tests after refactoring
- Ask Aider to add test coverage

## Limitations & Workarounds

### Cross-Origin Restrictions
- **Issue**: External sites can't be inspected
- **Workaround**: Use local development server

### Source Mapping
- **Issue**: Source files not always detected
- **Workaround**: Use development builds with source maps

### HMR Not Working
- **Issue**: Changes don't update automatically
- **Workaround**: Use "Refresh Preview" command
